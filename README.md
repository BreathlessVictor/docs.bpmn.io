# docs.bpmn.io :notebook:
Welcome to docs.bpmn.io. This repository contains documentation for:

 - diagram-js
 - bpmn-js
 - dmn-js

libraries.

## Running Locally
This repository is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via Github Pages. To run locally:

Install bundler if not installed before:
```shell
gem install bundler jekyll
```

Run the website:
```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This should take couple of minutes until the page is built and served in http://localhost:4000/docs.bpmn.io/

**Note about search**
    
Pages added & removed from the docs should automatically be handled, so no need to do extra steps in order to take care of search functionality.
